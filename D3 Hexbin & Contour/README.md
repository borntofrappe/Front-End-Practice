## Links

- [Previous project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/mdbErOG). The scatter plot was built to showcase the Delaunay package, but is used as a starting point for the style and overall structure.

- [D3 Hexbin](https://github.com/d3/d3-hexbin#_hexbin). Be sure to import the package as it is separate from the `d3` library.

- [D3 Contour](https://github.com/d3/d3-contour). Incorporated in the main library.
