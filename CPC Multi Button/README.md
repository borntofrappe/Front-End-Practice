# CPC Multi Buttons

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Recreate [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/3118647-3D-Touch-Action-Change) with SVG syntax and CSS transitions.

## Notes

This project is meant to be an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge. It allowed me to practice with several topics, among which:

- SVG syntax, including wrapping parts of an SVG in an anchor link element to make it select-able

- CSS custom properties

- CSS layout, finally got to use `column-reverse`

- handling mouse and key events

Most prominently however, the project was the perfect way to dive into CSS transitions.

In the **res** folder you find the assets created for the projects. These are also showcased in the `html` document found in the **Static** folder. Static is actually a misleading adjective, as I decided to add a couple lines of JavaScript to experiment with different color palettes.
