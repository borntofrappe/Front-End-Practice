# CPC Multi Button

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Recreate [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/3118647-3D-Touch-Action-Change) with SVG syntax.

## Notes

This project is meant to be an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge. Its name is subject to change as I find a better way to describe the contents packed in the project.

In the **res** folder you find the assets created for the projects. These are also showcased in the `html` document found in the **Static** folder. Static is actually a misleading adjective, as I decided to add a couple lines of JavaScript to experiment with different color palettes.
