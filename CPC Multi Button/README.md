# CPC Multi Buttons

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Recreate [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/3118647-3D-Touch-Action-Change) with SVG syntax and CSS transitions.

## Notes

This project was originally meant to replicate the design as much as possible. To this end, I designed the three icons from the referenced design, and included them in a working demo. Looking at the topic of the #codepenchallenge however, I discovered there was a prompt to create buttons from a template. Luckily for me, the template described to design a pen around three buttons describing the cut/copy/paste of a text editor. I therefore designed a new set of icons and changed the direction of the design.

Still, I enjoyed the original design so much that I decided to keep the project in the **Design** folder. In the **res** folder you find the assets created for both projects. In the **Static** folder you find finally a small experiment with CSS custom properties and different color palettes.
