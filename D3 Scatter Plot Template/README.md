# D3 Scatter Plot Template

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dybXpMJ)

## Goal

Create a template for a scatter plot illustrating the relation between two numerical variables, with linear scales and unstyled axes.

## Notes

This is meant as a template for the soon-to-be section on CodePen dedicated to the D3 library. As such, it is more focused on plotting the points and the axes than providing a complete visualization. The idea is to have developers fork the barebone project and use it as a starting point.
