# Small & Scalable Vector Graphic

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Starting from a SVG project creating a stamp create a small, but scalable illustration in a 100x150 pixel container.

## Notes

This project was originally meant to be an entry for the first week of September in the #codepenchallenge. Upon reviewing the rules though, I realized the challenge was centered around a container much smaller than 100x150 pixels. The project remains inspired by the challenge, but cannot rightfully be an entry for it.
