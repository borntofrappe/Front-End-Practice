# DTree

<!-- # [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Practice with hierarchical visualizations starting from a series of nested elements.

## Notes

This project is actually meant to be part of the [CodePen challenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2019/december/4) for the fourth week of December. Starting from [this template](https://codepen.io/team/codepen/pen/rNaWyWQ), the goal is to first create a JSON object describing the root-to-leaves structures, and then highlight the data with a series of visualizations afforded by the d3-hierarchy module.
