# DTree

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/XWJaNYP)

## Goal

Practice with d3-hierarchy to create a tree diagram.

## Notes

This project was born as an entry for the weekly [#codepenchallenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2019/december/4). On top of the tree diagram, I was able to also tinker with the `shape-outside` property to create a more intriguing layout.
