# SVG to Zdog

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Building upon the previous project recreate the SVG graphic in the pseudo-3d environment provided by the Zdog library.

## Notes

In the **SVG Project** folder you find the refined vector graphic. I decided to update the existing project to improve the way I drew the star and the triforce.
