# D3 Force Directed Graph

## Goal

Practice with D3 to create a force directed graph showcasing multiple planets through small circles.

## Notes

The project was originally meant to be an entry for the #codepenchallenge, and it will be actually used as the basis for such a challenge. Given the intricacies, and personal inexperience with `d3.simulation` and `d3.force` however, I decided to have this repo save an intermediate step, showcasing a force directed graph with one center of gravity, immediately shown on load, and have another folder dedicated to the challenge describing multiple centers of gravity as well as the possibility to transition between selected categories.
