# Zdog Sony

The idea is to use the Zdog library to recreate the three-dimensional feel of a couple of logos from Sony's Playstation.

## Depth

Animate a series of shapes as if growing in the `z` dimension. The "trick" is to have the path elements actually hidden behind a solid shape, of the same color of the background, and have the same transitioned, translated into view.

## Strokes

Draw multiple copies of a series of shapes, using the `x`, `y` and `z` dimensions as to create a series of adjacent towers.
