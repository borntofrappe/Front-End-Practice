# JS Stopwatch

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ExxzXKr)

## Goal

Create a stopwatch using vanilla JavaScript, `setInterval` or `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Notes

This project was actually prompted from a "help request", where I was asked to review the code creating a stopwatch using vanilla JavaScript. As I found a way to achieve such a functionality, I thought I'd document the journey and also experiment with the `requestAnimationFrame` method.
