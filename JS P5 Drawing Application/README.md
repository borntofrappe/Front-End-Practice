# JS P5.js Drawing App

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QPQPrv)

A work-in-progress

## Goal

Create an entry for the fifth episode of the #weeklycodingchallenge, with a drawing app using the canvas API and the [P5.js](http://p5js.org/) library.

## Notes

Features of the application (so far related mostly to the UI):

- a sidebar similar to the one featured on the [@codepen](https://codepen.io) official website, which can be toggled to show the options to change the pencil's color and stroke, as well as to clear the canvas from any drawing;

- a pencil icon substituting the mouse cursor when hovering on the canvas element.
