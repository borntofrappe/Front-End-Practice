# SVG Maze - Binary Tree

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/NWWxoJK)

## Goal

Create a maze using the binary tree algorithm, SVG syntax and JavaScript.

## Update

I cleaned up the script to:

1. separate the logic governing the maze and the marker;

1. follow the proper order of the algorithm. The script now checks if the gate opens up an exit only after selecting a direction north or east.
