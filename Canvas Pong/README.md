# Canvas Pong

[Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QWWPBrV)

## Goal

Dive into the Canvas API by creating an endless game of pong in which the paddles are moved automatically.

## Notes

I'm actually in the process of writing an article on this project, in the hope of publishing it soon. To this end, you find a helpful first version of the project in the **Static** folder. Here the code draws the shapes in the canvas element and introduces a couple of very useful methods in `context.save()` and `context.restore()`.

## Update

The code as described in the `script.js` file does work, but there's much room for improvement, from making the code more readable to restructuring a few repeated lines of code into a separate function.
