# Canvas Pong

<!-- [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Dive into the Canvas API by creating an endless game of pong in which the paddles are moved automatically.

## Notes

I'm actually in the process of writing an article on this project, in the hope of publishing it soon. To this end, you find a helpful first version of the project in the **Static** folder. Here the code draws the shapes in the canvas element and introduces a couple of very useful methods in `context.save()` and `context.restore()`.
