# SVG Tooltip Icons

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/OYBNgX)

## Goal

Practice with SVG syntax to create a series of icons shown when hovering atop a series of anchor link elements.

## Notes

The project was originally meant to be an entry for the #weeklycodingchallenge, devoted exactly to fabricating a tooltip. In the end however, I decided to devote the coding session strictly to SVG syntax, in order to practice with the `<use>` element and the nesting of multiple `<svg>` elements.
