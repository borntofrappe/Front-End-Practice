# SVG Progress

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/gNLKBw)

## Goal

Practice with SVG and anime.js to create a progress bar and animate its appearance in color and shape.

## Project Update

The project has been updated to use and reference `path` elements and modify the `d` attribute. You can find the previous, `polyline` version [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/vqgXKd), on in the `Progress Polyline` folder, but Microsoft Edge has a rather mysterious error message connected to the `getTotalLength()` method. I thought this had to do with the `polyline` element, as previous projects using the methods with the `path` element worked fine and indeed using the `path` element doesn't result in the same error.
