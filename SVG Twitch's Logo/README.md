# SVG Twitch's Logo

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/YzPzvMY)

## Goal

Improve [this CSS-only project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/qBEWeLE) using SVG syntax and enough JavaScript to make it interactive.

## Notes

In the **res** folder I added the project dedicated to drawing Twitch's Logo, or at least a first version, as well as the `.svg` file describing the logo sans circle (this version is actually included in the repeating pattern for the `background` property).
