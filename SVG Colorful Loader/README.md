# SVG Colorful Loader

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/mddNRpy)

## Goal

Taking inspiration from [this design](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/vYYMENR) create a flexible loader with SVG syntax and dat.gui.js.

## Notes

It's the first time I got to use the `dat.gui` library and I am positive there are much better ways to update the graphic following a change in the controls.
