# Zdog & Anime.js Dice

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/PooeQvG)

## Goal

Update the Zdog Dice project to roll the dice with the animation library and following user input.

## Notes

The [previous project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/WNNJxwM) didn't consider user input when rolling the dice, and instead allowed to rotate the shape through the `dragRotate` flag. The animation also relied on a `requestAnimationFrame()` function which continuously updated the graphic.

With this project I set out to rotate the dice to a specific face, using the animation library anime.js.
