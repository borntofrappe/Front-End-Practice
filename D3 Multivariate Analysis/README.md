# D3 Multivariate Analysis

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Highlight the relationship between multiple variables for four subspecies of the iris flower.

## Notes

This project is the culmination of a multi-part effort centered around the iris flower dataset. I plan to merge previous visualizations into a larger construct, displaying the iris flowers in a 4x4 grid.
Just like in [this visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set#/media/File:Iris_dataset_scatterplot.svg), the idea is to highlight the relationship between the variables through scatter plots. Unlike the mentioned SVG, the idea is to also describe the distribution of the individual variables, through histogram or density plots.
