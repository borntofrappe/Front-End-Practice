# JS Promise Rejection

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Practice with JavaScript and promises to create a button which always prompts an error message.

## Notes

This project was inspired by [this particular movie scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCK3r570AbQ). The idea is to have the button show a notification after a considerable amount of time, and to overlap each successive notification.
