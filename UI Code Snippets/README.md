# UI Code Snippets

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/PooaQGv)

## Goal

Create the basic structure for a component ultimately displaying the syntax of a chosen language.

## Update

I included the code as processed locally through the [shiki](http://shiki.matsu.io/) package. Eventually, this is meant to process every snippet to include `<span>` elements with the desired color.
