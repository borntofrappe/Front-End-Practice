# Zdog Unown

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Create the pokemon-based alphabet through the pseudo 3D engine.

## Notes

The idea is to practice with Zdog and specifically the path which can be drawn through the `Shape` class. It'd be might entertaining, once the alphabet is complete, to actually have them rotate around the center, and perhaps rotate the entire lot to display the key being pressed.
