# Rhythm Test

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/rbRaxG)

## Goal

Create a basic rhythm test through a button and a pseudo element.

## Notes

The project started out as a silly pretext to practice with a few JavaScript methods, but it turned out to be a rather insightful effort. I got to practice with the `overflow` property, different SVG icons and even a basic table layout.
