# [UI Time App Navigation](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WNrGjzQ)

Create a navigation for a hypothetical mobile application centered around time. The idea is to have the navigation provide a connection to different pages, features of the application:

- an alarm

- a clock

- a timer

- a stopwatch

The focus is on the SVG syntax and CSS animation which plays as each individual voice is selected.
