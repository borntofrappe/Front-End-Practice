# Vue Email Address

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/LYEbzae)

## Goal

Create a form allowing to check for a valid email address.

## Notes

This project is actually the first time I've ever used the **Vue** framework. It is also part of the #codepenchallenge for the third week of December, which actually inspired me to try the framework without a preview. For this last reason the UI is quite bare-bone and the SVG does not have the best aspect ratio.
