# Vue Email Address

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/LYEbzae)

## Goal

Create a form allowing to check for a valid email address.

## Notes

This project is actually the first time I've ever used the **Vue** framework. It is also part of the #codepenchallenge for the third week of December, which actually inspired me to try the framework without a preview. For this last reason the UI is quite bare-bone and the SVG does not have the best aspect ratio.

## Notice

While the folder describes three files in `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`, these do not allow to have the project running locally. To this end I need to research the Vue CLI. For a live demo, [the URL introducing the project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/LYEbzae) should currently be enough.
