# Canvas Clip

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/wvvLwLG)

## Goal

Experiment with the Canvas API and specifically the possibility to clip parts of a canvas to show a subset of existing elements.

## Notes

This is a continuation of the deep dive started with a previous project using the Canvas API [to create a Pong game](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/QWWPBrV).
