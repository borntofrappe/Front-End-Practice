# SVG Flower Animation

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/qBdzaZG)

## Goal

Animate the icon of a flower and a bee with anime.js.

## Notes

anime.js is used purely to make the animation and most importantly sequence between the different stages of the animation easier.

In `flower.svg` you find a first rendition of the flower. I expanded the viewbox in order to introduce the bee, but fundamentally the SVG syntax in that file is responsible for 80% of the project.
