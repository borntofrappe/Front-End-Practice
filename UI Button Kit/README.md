# Button UI Kit

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Participate to the #weeklycodingchallenge creating a series of buttons.

## The idea

Show a set of buttons, styled in the following variants:

- primary: with a colored background and white text;

- secondary: with white text and a colored border;

- tertiary: with a small underline, no border, no colored background;

- disabled: a washed out color, a matching cursor.

It would be additionally neat to:

- make it so that any time a button is clicked a new set of buttons is included with a different color;

- use HSL and CSS custom properties.
