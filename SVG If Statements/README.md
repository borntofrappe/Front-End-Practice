# SVG If Statements

## [Live Demo]()

## Goal

Animate a series of path element with boolean logic.

## Notes

This is not only a good excuse to practice some vanilla APIs, like `document.createElement` and `document.createElementNS`, but also the perfect chance to explore the `viewBox` attribute of SVG elements.

Not going to lie, it took me a while to figure out the value of the viewBox

A framework could have also helped
