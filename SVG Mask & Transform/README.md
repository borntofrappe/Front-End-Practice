# SVG Mask & Transform

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QWwMGBM)

## Goal

Create and animate a mask to temporarily hide a portion of an SVG drawing.

## Notes

This project was inspired by [the recent annular eclipse on December 26th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2019).

Alternative title: "SVG Mask and Transform". Truth be told, I got to practice with the `textPath` element and `textLength` attribute as well. There are some cross-browser inconsistencies when using this last attribute (specifically _where_ the attribute needs to be specified), but I've managed to make it work by repeating its value on multiple elements. I've noted this inconsistency in the comments.
