# SVG Squares to Triangle

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/NWWVWMY)

## Goal

Explain how to draw a triangle by using a square and a mask element, with SVG syntax and anime.js.

## Notes

This effort is actually connected to two previous projects:

-   [SVG Dodecagon](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/JjjLxrx), introducing the concept to draw a series of triangles.

-   [SVG Color Wheel](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/vYYMENR), using pug to create an interactive demo, this time using a semicircle as the basis of the mask to draw slices of a pie chart.
