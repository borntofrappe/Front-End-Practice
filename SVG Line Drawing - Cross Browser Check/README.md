# SVG Line Drawing - Cross Browser Check

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Animate two path elements through `stroke-dash` properties accounting for browsers not supporting the pathLength attribute.

## Notes

This project was actually an entertaining look at different browsers and how they implement the `stroke-dash` properties. It's also a lesson on how presentational attributes are overwritten by CSS properties.
