# D3 Election Dashboard

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ZNjgmv)

## Goal

Inspired by the recent European elections, display the composition of the EU parliament through a series of visualizations.

## Visualizations

The dashboard highlights two visualizations:

- a donut chart (half a donut chart in actuality) displaying the current composition of the European parliament. In addition to the d3-powered visualization, this chart is complemented by a legend, highighting the connected slices through color.

- a row chart (two row charts to be precise) displaying the number of seats accummulated by the parties in the previous and current elections.

## Source

The visualizations benefit from the inspiring work done @lemondefr and specifically [right here](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2019/05/26/elections-europeennes-les-resultats-dans-l-ue-pays-par-pays_5467557_4355770.html).
