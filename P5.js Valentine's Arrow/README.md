# P5.js Valentine's Arrow

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Create a game with p5.js and a canvas element allowing to shoot arrows toward heart-shaped targets.

## Notes

In the **res** folder you find a first attempt at drawing the assets for the game. I picked SVG syntax and a few path elements to detail the arrow, including the heart and the feather. There are also a couple of path elements using curve commands to draw close-to-believable clouds. It could also work as a loader introducing the game.

## Color Palette

The project is based on four colors, using a red color with different saturation and lightness values.

-   lighter shade, for the background: `hsl(40, 100%, 95%)`;

-   slightly darker shade, for the clouds: `hsl(40, 85%, 70%)`;

-   darker shade, for the arrow: `hsl(25, 85%, 15%)`;

-   saturated shade, for the heart: `hsl(15, 100%, 60%)`.
