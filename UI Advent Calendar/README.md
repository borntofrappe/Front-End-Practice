# UI Advent Calendar

<!-- [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Create an advent calendar on top of an image and with a grid of checkboxes.

## Notes

The idea of this project is to use grid properties to overlay 24 input of type checkbox on [this particular image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/macro-shot-photography-of-christmas-stockings-ornament-on-a-christmas-tree-1671872/).

Using the checkbox hack and 3D transform properties, it ought to be possible to also emulate the opening and closing of the different windows.
