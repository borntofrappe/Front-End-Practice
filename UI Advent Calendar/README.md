# UI Advent Calendar

[Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/OJPjKdY)

## Goal

Experiment with a grid layout to create an advent calendar.

## Notes

The idea of this project is to use grid properties to overlay 24 input of type checkbox on [this particular image](https://www.pexels.com/photo/lighted-christmas-tree-1708601/).

Using the checkbox hack and 3D transform properties, it ought to be possible to also emulate the opening and closing of the different windows.
