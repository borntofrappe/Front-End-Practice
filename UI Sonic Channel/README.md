# UI Sonic Channel

<!-- ## Live Demo -->

## Goal

Replicate the background and navigation bar of the [Sonic 2020 website](http://sonic.sega.jp/SonicChannel/sonic2020/).

## Notes

This project begun as an experiment to impose a semitransparent repeating pattern on a background, but exploring the Japanese website, I stumbled on the neat animation behind the navigation. Unfortunately, it works only on hover and not on focus, but the animation allows to momentarily show a graphic, in this instance a few stars, before showing the text of the anchor link in a new palette.
