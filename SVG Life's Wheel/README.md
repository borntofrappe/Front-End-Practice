# Life's Wheel

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/eYYxLPe)

## Goal

Inspired by the semi-popular board game create a spin-able wheel with SVG syntax.

## Notes

The project takes advantage of the `mask` element as well as a series of `use` tags. This can be thought as a follow up from [this project](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/JjjLxrx) creating a triangle out of squares, and might actually be an entertaining topic for a post.
