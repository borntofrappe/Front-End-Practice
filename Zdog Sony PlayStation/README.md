# [Zdog Sony](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/RwrageZ)

The idea is to use the Zdog library to create a pseudo-3d visual inspired by the Sony's Playstation. The rather simplistic animation is handled with `requestAnimationFrame`, and by changing the scale in both the `x` and `y` dimension. For more control, for instance to have a non-linear easing function, consider using an animation library.
