# Wink Button

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QWwyjvB)

## Goal

Practice with JavaScript and promises to create a button which always prompts an error message.

## Notes

This project was inspired by [this particular movie scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCK3r570AbQ). The idea is to have the button show a notification after a considerable amount of time, and to overlap each successive notification.

## Update

Following a request, I updated the project to play a sound bite as the button is pressed and as the request is rejected.
