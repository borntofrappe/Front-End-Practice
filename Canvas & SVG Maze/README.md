# Canvas & SVG Maze

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/mdyNdpB)

## Goal

Draw a couple of mazes with the Canvas API and SVG syntax.

## Inspiration

The concept, and most prominently the color palette, was inspired by this [tantalizing design](https://dribbble.com/shots/6397028-What-Is-Personalization-and-What-Does-It-Mean-To-Marketers) from [Karolina Niedbalo](https://dribbble.com/niedbalo).

I am still unable to draw a random maze with a circular layout, but with the basic binary tree algorithm is able to draw intriguing shapes on its own.
