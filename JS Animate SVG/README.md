# JS Animate SVG

<!-- ## Live Demo -->

## Goal

Taking inspiration from the F1 youtube channel, replicate the first frame of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTmX420cb7A), showcasing the evolution of the vehicles' design up to the 1000th grand prix.

## Notes

A perfect pretext to practice with _svg morphing_ and with the JavaScript animation library _anime.js_.
