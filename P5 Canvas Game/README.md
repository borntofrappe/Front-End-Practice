## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/BaBeNoV)

## Goal

Create a basic shooting game using P5.js and the canvas element.

## Notes

The project was inspired by [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), enticing me to tinker with the specific library. It was also inspired by a JavaScript conference, which used the concept as the introduction to its 2014 talks. [Here's one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxDM7OgPuKU) as a frame of reference.
