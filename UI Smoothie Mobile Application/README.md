# UI Smoothie Mobile App

## Goal

Inspired by [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/5410284-Smoothie-Land) create the UI of a mobile application allowing to order soya smoothies with particular flavors.

## Notes

The SVG files included in the **res** folder are the result of VSCode and Inkscape combined. I am still not qualified as a graphic designer, and I definitely need to improve the way I design icons.
