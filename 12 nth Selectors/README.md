# 12 Days of Christmas

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/NWPGvjW)

## Goal

Practice with CSS selectors and property-value pairs to create an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge.

## Notes

In the **res** folder you find the vector graphics developed for the project, for the cursor and the background, but also another CSS-based project in **Scroll Snap**. This is an experiment with `scroll-snap-type` property to create a vertical slider which snaps for every list item.
