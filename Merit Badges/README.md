# Merit Badges

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/zYOmJMR)

## Goal

Inspired by [these vector graphics](https://css-tricks.com/web-development-merit-badges/) create a template for badges awarded to arbitrary achievements.

## Update

This project begun as a way to practice with SVG syntax, while replicating one of the badges on the referenced website. Only later I decided to create a different design, and in the while create a template for anybody to fork and improve.

You can still find the result of the first practice session in `estimate.html`, and also [here on CodePen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ExYdeXw).

_Please note_: on CodePen I decided to use **[pug](https://pugjs.org)** instead of JavaScript, and in so doing practice with the language. I also picked up [stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) as a pre-processor for the few property-value pairs describing the stylesheet.

For posterity, you can find the `.pug` and `.styl` files in the **res** folder.
