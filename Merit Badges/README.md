# Merit Badges

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/zYOmJMR)

## Goal

Inspired by [these vector graphics](https://css-tricks.com/web-development-merit-badges/) create a template for badges awarded for arbitrary achievements.

## Update

The project originally begun as a way to practice with SVG syntax, while replicating one of the badges on the referenced website. Only later I decided to create a different design, and in the while create a template for anybody to fork and improve.

You can still find the original design in `estimate.html`, but also [here on CodePen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ExYdeXw).

_Please note_: both projects live CodePen rely on **[pug](https://pugjs.org)** to create the outer border for the badges. No JavaScript.
