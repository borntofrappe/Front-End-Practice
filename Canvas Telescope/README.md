# Canvas Telescope

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Draw a starry sky and animate a clip to create an interactive telescope following a mouse cursor.

## Notes

This is a continuation of the deep dive started with a previous project using the Canvas API [to create a Pong game](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/QWWPBrV).
