# UX Typography

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/KKPWOzZ)

## Goal

Practice with CSS and JavaScript while replicating parts of the design from [this website](https://thomasjockin.github.io/lexend/).

## Notes

I updated the project by cleaning up the script. In terms of layout, I also added a media query to make the page more digestible on smaller viewports.
