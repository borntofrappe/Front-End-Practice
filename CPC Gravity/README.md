# CPC Gravity Golf

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/KLqbag)

## Goal

Create an entry for the weekly codepen challenge to create a basic game of golf. Play with the concept of gravity and the physics library _matter.js_ to have the ball react differently in different locations.

## Update

Given the complexity behind the matter.js library, I decided to split the project in multiple efforts. The selection screen and the game screen are highlighted in separate folders, while the root files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are home to the project wrapping everything up.
