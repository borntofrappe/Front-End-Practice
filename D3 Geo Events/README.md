# D3 Geo Events

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Recreate a visualization plotting a map of the US and highlighting a few events at specific locations.

## Notes

The mail was sent by Kent C. Dodds to highlight a few conferences and workshops he's organized in the US. The clean design and limited color palette really struck me and was enough to sparkle the D3 project.
