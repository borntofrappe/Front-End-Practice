# D3 Geo Events

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WNeRmdp)

## Goal

Recreate a visualization plotting a map of the US and highlighting a few events at specific locations.

## Notes

The mail was sent by Kent C. Dodds to highlight a few conferences and workshops he's organized in the US. The clean design and limited color palette really struck me and was enough to sparkle the D3 project.

Note that in the **res** folder you also find three icons used to highlight the location and nature of the event. These are included alongside the text describing the title of the matching event.
