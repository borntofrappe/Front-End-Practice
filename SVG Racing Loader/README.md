# SVG Racing Loader

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Replicate [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/3395665-F1-Aerodynamics) and animate the stroke's dashes to create a loading screen.

## Notes

In the **res** folder you find two `.svg` files describing the visuals behind the project. Please note that in the **racing-car** file the syntax is slightly different. To animate the car and the dashes I had to adjust a few attributes, and most prominently remove path elements with pre-existing `stroke-dasharray` attributes.
