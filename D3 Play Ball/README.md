# D3 Play Ball

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/xxKdjwQ)

## Goal

Recreate the concept behind [this interactive visualization](https://twitter.com/chartball/status/1139387701658939395), describing the evolution of a basketball game.

## Update

I decided to try and animate the visualization as highlighted in the status quoted above. In the **static** folder you find the complete visualization sans animation. I thought it best to isolate the specific project to later consider the adjustments made to introduce the animation. In the **res** folder you also find two SVG icons I decided to include in the background of the page.
