# SVG Final Fantasy Loaders

## Live Demo(s)

- [Spinning Loader](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/mdeyYQV)

- [Grid Loader](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/gOabbqY)

- [Grid Loader - Pug](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/dyYPMBG)

## Goal

Animate SVG syntax with CSS to create a couple of loading components.

## Notes

This project actually spans a couple of days, and a few more demos.

- Grid Loader animates a series of squares, in sequence and in scale/opacity. I've recreated the code with the templating language **Pug** to experiment with different durations/delays.

- Spinning Loader animates a series of path elements, of which only a section is made visible. Using a mask it is possible to create the illusion of contiguous strokes.
