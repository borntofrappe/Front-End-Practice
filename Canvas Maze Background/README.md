# Canvas Maze Background

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Draw a maze in the background with a canvas element and a basic algorithm.

## Inspiration

The concept, and most prominently the color palette, was inspired by this [tantalizing design](https://dribbble.com/shots/6397028-What-Is-Personalization-and-What-Does-It-Mean-To-Marketers) from [Karolina Niedbalo](https://dribbble.com/niedbalo).
