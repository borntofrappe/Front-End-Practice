# D3 Hexbin

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/bXaezg)

## Goal

Visualize arbitrary statistics on the honey market and for a few countries of the European Union.

## Notes

The data is collected from [this PDF presentation](https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sites/agriculture/files/honey/market-presentation-honey_en.pdf), and accounts for the average number of beehives held by each beekeeper as well as the average yield per beehive. It could be argued that these dimensions allow to study the productivity of the market in the continent, but the project's goal is learning the specific module and practicing with D3 layout function in general.
