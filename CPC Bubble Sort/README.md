# CPC Bubble Sort

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/WWLXGN)

## Goal

Create an entry for the last codepenchallenge themed around algorithms and specifically about the bubble sort algorithm.

## Notes

The visualization introduced with the differently-colored columns doesn't do justice to the fact that, behind the scenes and in the `js` script, the project does using a bubble sort algorithm. There exist precisely a function dedicated to go through an array, for as many times are there are items, and swapping at each iterations the items based on their `data-hue` attribute.

The local file might also differ from the live demo as I was experimenting with a different number of columns, and found it best to leave the pen with as many columns as there are hues on the color wheel.
