# Pokemon Alphabet

-   [SVG Alphabet](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ExajrPO)

## Goal

Recreate the alphabet based on the 26+ version of the popular pokemon unown, with SVG and Zdog.

## Notes

In its original version, this was meant to be a project focused solely on the pseudo-3d engine Zdog. I decided to also include a 2D variant to practice with SVG syntax. You can find the specific version in the folder bearing the same name.

The SVG project allows to actually create the basis for the Zdog version.
