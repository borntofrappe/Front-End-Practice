# Pokemon Alphabet

## Live Demo(s)

-   [SVG Alphabet](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ExajrPO)

-   [Zdog Unown](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/VwYLgXv)

## Goal

Recreate the alphabet based on the 26+ version of the popular pokemon unown, with SVG and Zdog.

## Notes

In its original version, this was meant to be a project focused solely on the pseudo-3d engine Zdog. I decided to instead draw the 26+ critters using SVG syntax, and dedicate Zdog to only one specimen.
