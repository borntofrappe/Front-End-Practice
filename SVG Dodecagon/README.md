# SVG Dodecagon

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/JjjLxrx)

## Goal

Experiment with SVG syntax to recreate the shape and animation showcased in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/MagicPi2/status/1191799284481572866).

## Notes

In the **res** folder you find the `.pug` code I ended up using for the project on CodePen. I decided to use the preprocessor to avoid repeating the use elements, but fundamentally the code is equivalent to the markup described in `index.html`.
