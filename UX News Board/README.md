# UI News Board

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/XQOVpE)

## Goal

Create a bulletin board inspired by the design showcased on the website of a popular mobile game.


## Notes

The game in question is called [Dragalia Lost](https://dragalialost.com/en/), a mobile game with rather enticing visuals. This might not be the first UI project I set out to create after the title.

In this project I relied heavily on:

- CSS grid to position the elements in a responsive layout;

- JavaScript array methods to craft and inject mock data.
