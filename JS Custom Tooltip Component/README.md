# Custom Tooltip

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QRzNqE)

## Goal

Practice with the Web Component API to create anchor link elements equipped with a tooltip. Hover on anchor link elements to highlight more information on the destination URL.

## Update

Since the effort required quite a bit of discovery around event listeners, to couple the CSS animation with JavaScript-powered transition, I decided to split the project in two stages. In the _Proof of Concept_ folder you find exactly the proof of concept, with a single anchor link element showing a specific form of the tooltip. The root folder is instead home to the `html`, `css`, `script` files benefiting from the Web Component API.
