# Matter JS Plinko

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QWWwOWO)

## Goal

Practice with array methods and the physics engine to recreate the basic structure behind a plinko game.

## Notes

This project is inspired by [this coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KakpnfDv_f0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bLh3T_4wtrmVHOrOEM1ig_&index=6), but uses vanilla JavaScript instead of P5.js. This allows me to practice with array methods on top of matter.js.
