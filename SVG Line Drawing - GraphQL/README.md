# SVG Line Drawing - GraphQL

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/mdymQBx)

## Goal

Replicate and animate the [GraphQL logo](http://graphql.org/) with SVG syntax, anime.js and dat.gui.

## Update

I decided to include [dat.gui](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) to make the project slightly more interactive.
