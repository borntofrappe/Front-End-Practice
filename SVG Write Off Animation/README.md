# SVG Write Off Animation

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/VJQBZe)

## Goal

Draw a pencil and animate the graphic to continuously include and remove a stroke.

## Notes

The project, while small, incorporates an important feature in the **res** folder, where you find the individual asset for the pencil. The idea is to create graphics with a clear, individual purpose, and incorporate these graphics in larger encompassing compositions.
