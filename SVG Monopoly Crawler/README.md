# SVG Monopoly Crawler

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Couple SVG syntax with the pseudo-3d engine _Zdog_ and the animation library _anime.js_ to explore a monopoly board one step at a time.

## Notes

This project is made possible thanks to two previous efforts with the mentioned library, where I ended up creating the canvas element displaying the 3D dice. [Here's the first version using Zdog only](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/WNNJxwM) and [here's the version including anime.js](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/PooeQvG)
