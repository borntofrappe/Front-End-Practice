# D3 Meteorite Landings

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/VwZqZOY)

## Goal

For a [take-home project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/map-data-across-the-globe) in the curriculum @freecodecamp, highlight the sites for a series of meteorite landings.

## Update

In the **D3 Geo** folder your find a first visualization, focused solely on the mapping of the world's features. Given the intricacies of the `geo` module I thought it best to save the intermediate step, to possibly build on top of the concept at a later stage.
