# Front End Practice

> Repository allowing to practice with web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS by building projects.

## Goal(s)

The brief description behind the repository does justice to the purpose behind this repository. As I begin a new round of the #100daysofcode challenge, as I decide to retire my [previous repository](https://github.com/borntofrappe/Practice-Front-End-Web-Development) collecting front-end projects, I set out to use this repository as a new hub for anything front-end related. Be it an SVG drawing, a D3 radial tree, a React proof-of-concept, you'll find here a few, and possibly more, projects allowing me to learn by doing.

Currently, I set out to focus on the following topics:

- React;

- D3;

- testing.

This doesn't mean I will forgo projects benefitting from vanilla HTML, CSS, JS. It just means that starting on the 4th of April 2019 and for the possibly few months which follow this data I plan to discover, practice and learn to the best of my abilities the specified technologies. There might be projects not connected to the short list, but I believe them to be a catalyst toward becoming a better developer; most prominently and in some cases, I believe them to be a gateway toward a more solid understanding of the described tech (think of SVG syntax, and how projects detailing the vector-based graphic will undoubtedly help with the data visualization library D3).
