# Front End Practice

HTML, CSS, JS. These are the core technologies entertained in this repository. This does not preclude libraries or other technologies altogether (hello SVG), but does give a direction to the folder at hand. I want to practice as a developer working on the front end, and I can't see a better way of doing that than by producing a series of often-practical projects.

## Project(s)

Currently, I divide the projects in the following sub-categories:

- [D3](#d3);

- [JS](#js);

- [React](#js); <!-- smaller scale react projects; for larger application I prefer using a separate repo -->

- [SVG](#svg);

- [UI UX](#ui-ux);

- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous).

There are overlaps, but the category is meant to describe the core feature of the project. The answer to the question: what is the thing I want to practice most with this.
