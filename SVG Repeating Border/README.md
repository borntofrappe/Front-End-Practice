# SVG Repeating Border

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Use SVG syntax to create a border with a repeating pattern.

## Notes

This project was inspired by [Doodle.com](https://doodle.com/), and the recept provided by the scheduling service following an appointment.

It was also made possible thanks to [this video on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/lodge/svg/06-using-svg-svg-background-image/), explaining how SVG syntax can be handily used in the `background` property of any HTML element.
