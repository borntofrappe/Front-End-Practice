# D3 Line Column Sankey

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/zVwGaP)

## Goal

Practice with the data visualization library to highlight data in a line chart, row chart, sankey diagram.

## Notes

The practice session is inspired by an article from the French newspaper [lemonde](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2019/06/20/ou-ont-fui-les-74-8-millions-de-personnes-contraintes-a-l-exil_5479071_4355770.html). The data is collected from  the [UN Refugee Agency](http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/overview), which itself provides a couple of insightful visualizations. In a future practice session I might revisit the website to cover the geomap and the in-depth, interactive column chart found on the homepage.
