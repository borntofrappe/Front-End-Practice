# Morse Code Alphabet

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/bGNNRQb)

## Goal

Display information connected to the morse alphabet with an interactive table element.

## Notes

This project is meant to practice with a table element, but also other layout techniques. It'd be intriguing to use CSS grid to display the same information but in a different fashions.

In both instances, I'd like to use SVG syntax to both draw the different codes and animate them.
