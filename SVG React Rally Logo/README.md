# SVG React Rally Logo

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/KKPZWQK)

## Goal

Recreate and animate the logo from [the Youtube channel of the React Rally conference](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXBhQ05nu3L1abBUGeQ0ahw).

## Notes

In the **res** folder you find the vector graphic behind the logo. It is slightly different from the SVG included in the markup document, as I needed to refactor the rays of light to animate them individually.
