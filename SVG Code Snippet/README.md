# SVG Code Snippet

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/OevZVw)

## Goal

Display a code snippet replicating the Github interface and using SVG elements.

## Notes

Beside replicating the code snippet, the project includes a few lines of JavaScript to create a copy of the SVG element and overlay it on top of the existing one. The idea is to then clip the element, alter its viewBox as to create a zoomed-in version of the graphic. The effect is welcomed, but could use a definite upgrade, for instance to reposition the circle following the mouse coordinates.
