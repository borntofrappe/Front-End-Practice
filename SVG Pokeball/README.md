# SVG Pokeball Animation

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/zgYgKp)

## Goal

Design a pokeball with SVG syntax and manage keyframe animations with JavaScript.

## Notes

The pokeball is absolutely inspired by [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/6048003-Poke-Coaster).

In the **res** folder you find an SVG file with the standalone graphic, but this one differs from the one included in the markup. In the HMTL document the SVG has additional group, path and circle elements, included solely for the animation.
