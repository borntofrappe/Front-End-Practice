# CPC Primed Cicada

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/QPxvBM)

## Goal

Create an entry for the weekly #codepenchallenge, themed around cicadas and prime numbers. Inspired by [this particular design](https://dribbble.com/shots/5524976-Cicada).

## Notes

It started as a trivial project, and it certainly could use a tune-up, especially in terms of the chosen colors. However, it has been a solid effort allowing for plenty of practice with SVG syntax and JavaScript's default arguments.
