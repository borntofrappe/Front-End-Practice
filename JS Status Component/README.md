# JS Status Component

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ROYvBd)

## Goal

Practice with the Web Components API while tinkering with the `window.ononline` and `window.onoffline` events, to create a bold header displaying the online/offline status of the visitor.

## Notes

The fonts being used by the custom components are made available in the global stylesheet. This means the component does rely on the light DOM. Something to be cognizant about.
