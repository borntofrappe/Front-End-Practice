# SVG Day & Night Toggle

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/aboPapm)

## Goal

Practice with SVG syntax to recreate [this inspiring toggle](https://dribbble.com/shots/5321869-Playing-with-InVision-Studio).

## Update

In the **res** folder you find the vector graphics developed for the toggle. They are drawn separately, but ultimately included in the same element, one above the other.
