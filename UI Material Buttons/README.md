## Goal

Practice with custom properties, clip-path, pseudo elements and CSS as a whole to create a series of buttons inspired by the material UI.

## Lessons Learned

transition can have a negative delay, and it seems it works similar to a negative `animation-delay`, meaning the change starts "midway".

In the project at hand, setting a negative delay allows to have the `clip-path` property begin from a value higher than `0`.
