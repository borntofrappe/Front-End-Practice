# SVG Holy Bucket

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/abbQgOp)

## Goal

Create an illustration inspired by [this video on generative data visualizations](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/generative-data-visualization-design-and-planning).


## Update

I decided to rewrite the illustration by removing the `<use>` elements and instead repeat the drawing elements like `<path>` and `<ellipse>` as needed. This should make it clearer to scan the different parts of the graphic. Most importantly, it should make it easier to include the graphic in the eventual data visualization.
