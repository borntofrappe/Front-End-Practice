# D3 Histogram and Density Plot

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dBeKga)

## Goal

Create two different visualizations to highlight the distribution of the length of the petals of a subspecies of irises.

## Notes

This is part of a larger exercise with the D3 library, ultimately with the goal of creating a _correlogram_ hihglighting the entire iris's dataset in a grid of 4x4 visualizations.
