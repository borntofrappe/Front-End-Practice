## Topics Covered

- CSS custom properties

## Final Notes

I am thorn on whether label this project as a productive effort. There's been a lot of pixel adjusting, especially for a few icons, but I've certainly got comfortable reading and fabricating SVG syntax by hand. Whether this translates to tangible improvements in my data-viz and otherwise SVG related projects is up to debate. And future application.
