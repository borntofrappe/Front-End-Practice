# 12 Days of Christmas

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Practice with CSS selectors and property-value pairs to create an entry for the weekly codepen challenge.

## Notes

While technically not part of the #codepenchallenge, I was inspired by the markup to experiment with the `scroll-snap-type` property. In the **Scroll Snap** folder you find the result of such an experiment, with a verticaly slider detailing the twelve days of christmas.
