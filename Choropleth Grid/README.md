## Notes

[This article](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2019/06/03/a-roland-garros-il-n-y-a-pas-de-francais-en-quarts-de-finale-pour-la-premiere-fois-depuis-l-an-dernier_5470946_4355770.html) inspired the project. The dataset is much larger, but the project is more a proof of concept than a way to thoroughly analyse the trend of tennis players.
