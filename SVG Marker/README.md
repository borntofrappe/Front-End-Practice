# SVG Marker

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Define marker elements at the beginning and end of path elements.

## Notes

In the **Marker** folder you find a proof of concept for the marker elements added on the path element edges. The idea is to ultimately use the marker elements in a data visualization plotting Google trends for the python language.
