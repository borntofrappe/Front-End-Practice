# SVG Saving Animation

The idea is to recreate the animation which plays out in the pokemon games sword and shield, when a player saves its progress.

## Notes

To get started, create two graphics: `saving.svg` and `saved.svg`. The idea is to animate the syntax behind the first one, and only after this animation has played out, move toward the second graphic.
